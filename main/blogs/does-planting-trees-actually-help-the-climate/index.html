                        <span style="font-style: italic;" >Want to do something good for the Earth? Plant a tree.</span> This 
common belief, once an inspiration for Earth Day T-shirts, now forms the
 basis of a booming global industry. As countries try to meet their 
climate change goals and businesses look to cancel out their carbon 
dioxide emissions, almost 2 billion trees are being planted every year.

                        Trees lock away carbon in their trunks, branches, leaves, and roots, 
making them an excellent partner in countering climate change. A report
 out last Thursday found that the understudied cooling effects of trees —
 like their role in the water cycle and the compounds they emit — have 
kept the planet half a degree Celsius cooler, not even accounting for the carbon dioxide they capture.

                        People have gotten so excited about taking on climate change by 
planting trees everywhere — with plans underway to grow a forest across the whole width of Africa, cover a third of India in forests, and plant 1 trillion trees around the world by 2030 — that the world is approaching a seed shortage.

                        But a growing body of research has cast doubt on all these efforts, 
raising questions about tree planting as a fix for the climate crisis. 
Mass planting efforts have often resulted in dead trees, degraded 
ecosystems, and — in at least one case — actual deforestation.
 The research suggests that even though trees themselves are great at 
capturing planet-warming gases, planting them is often another, more 
complicated story.

                    <h2>The changing math</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are plenty of ways that trees make our lives better. Studies
 show that their presence makes people happier and healthier. In cities,
 trees provide much-needed shade on hot summer days, remove pollution 
from the air, and help manage stormwater, reducing runoff and improving 
its quality.

                        Forests have long been seen as part of the solution to climate change, starting with the Kyoto Protocol
 in 1992, but ambitions have grown in recent years. A study from 2019 found that a global planting program could sequester two-thirds of the 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere emitted by humans. The article was 
covered by hundreds
 of news outlets with optimistic headlines about trees’ “mind-blowing potential
” and fueled another surge of planting programs.

                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        Some scientists questioned that study, arguing that it had overstated
 where all these new forests could be planted. Others pointed out that 
calling forestation the “most effective climate change solution to date”
 overlooked a more obvious, trusty solution: reducing fossil fuel 
emissions. The original authors corrected their paper, acknowledging the
 oversight and clarifying that adding more forests could only absorb about half of what they’d projected.

                        No one disputes that trees store a lot of carbon, but some experts 
say that these estimates tend to be overly optimistic — perhaps because 
people so badly want tree-planting to work. It’s a solution supported by
 a broad spectrum of people, including former President Donald Trump, 
who signed the U.S. up for a global effort to plant 1 trillion trees. 
Whereas cutting fossil fuels
 has proven politically difficult, trees are a rare climate fix that’s 
popular — and some scientists may hesitate to pour water on it. In 2014,
 a researcher who warned that relying on planting trees to slow climate 
change was too risky in a New York Times op-ed reported getting death threats.

                        “There’s just been a lot of enthusiasm for 
the idea that we can use nature-based solutions to back our way out of a
 climate problem,” said Carla Staver, an ecology professor at Yale 
University, who’s calling for more accurate measurements of carbon sequestration.

                    <p>
                        In a recent study
 published in Nature, Staver and other researchers at Yale, Harvard, the
 U.S. Forest Service, and Kruger National Park in South Africa wanted to
 clarify how much carbon could be stored by planting trees in one 
particular kind of ecosystem: savannas. These grassy plains dotted with 
trees cover one-fifth of the world’s land, much of it in Africa, and are
 a common target of tree-planting programs.

                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        Previous research estimated that turning savannas into forests could capture 280 tons
 of carbon per hectare. But the new study, based on experiments at 
Kruger National Park, found that the actual potential was much, much 
smaller — about 23 tons per hectare, or 8 percent of the old estimate.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        Staver characterized the miscalculation as an “innocent mistake.” One
 of the problems is that it’s easier to estimate how much carbon is 
stored aboveground, in towering trees, than belowground, where plants 
store carbon in their roots.

                    <p>
                        When it comes to big tree-planting initiatives in savannas, “it seems
 somewhere between possible and likely that they don’t sequester as much
 carbon as people have suggested that they do,” she said. According to 
Staver, the research may have implications for an ongoing initiative to 
plant 150 square miles of acacia trees in the Republic of Congo, an 
effort to offset emissions from the French oil company Total.

                        Experts say that afforestation,
 or planting trees where there wasn’t forest before, like in a grassland
 or savanna, can create a host of problems, hurting water supplies and 
threatening plant and animal species. “That’s just an ecological 
disaster, definitely from a biodiversity perspective and maybe from a 
carbon perspective,” said Fangyuan Hua, a conservation ecologist at 
Peking University in China.

                    <h2>When tree planting goes wrong</h2>
                    <p>
                        Tree-planting programs have run into problems from the start. In 
                        1987, an executive at the energy company AES Corporation had the idea of
                         trying to cancel out 40 years of CO2 emissions from its coal plant in 
                        Connecticut by planting trees in the mountains of Guatemala.
                    </p>

                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        It was the first “carbon offset” project — and while it sounded fine in theory, it didn’t go exactly as planned.
                        As farmers in the region started planting trees, they weren’t growing 
                       as many crops as they used to and started running low on food. Then, 
                       before the 40-year project was over, the locals began cutting down the trees for fuel and lumber. In 2009, one study calculated that the program had only offset about 10 percent of the coal plant’s emissions.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        Such problems have continued to plague tree-planting projects. The 
                        vast amount of land required to plant trees to suck up carbon, the U.N. 
                        Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in a report last month, will take up land needed to grow food and also make it harder for some plant and animal species to survive.

                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>
                        Plus, the trees that are planted don’t always get the care and 
                        attention they need to survive, and they sometimes end up displacing 
                        native forests. In Turkey, volunteers planted 11 million trees around 
                        the country on one day in 2019; a couple of months later, as many as 90 percent
                         of the saplings were dead, a result of being planted at the wrong time 
                        and not getting enough water. That same year, a tree-planting program in
                         Mexico may have actually caused deforestation: Farmers were cutting 
                        down the jungle to get money to plant new seeds, leading to the loss of 
                        an estimated 280 square miles of forest, roughly the size of New York City.

                    <p>
                        Last fall, a comprehensive study
                        in the journal Nature found that decades of expensive tree-planting 
                       efforts in parts of India had proved ineffective, as they hadn’t managed
                        to increase forest cover or help the locals. There simply wasn’t much 
                       space for planting trees in cleared areas, which were needed for growing
                        food or grazing. So the newly planted trees usually replaced existing 
                       forests, shifting them away from the native trees that locals valued 
                       more.

                        “Planting trees might seem like a 
                        straightforward way to increase carbon storage but the process of 
                        growing trees is expensive and complicated in many real-world contexts,”
                         the study’s authors wrote. They explained that planting new trees 
                        doesn’t address the root of the problem: the social and economic 
                        pressures that led to deforestation to begin with.

                        On top of all that, when forests are lost, the trees that replace them don’t provide the same benefits. In a recent study,
                        Hua and researchers around the world looked at the differences between 
                       native forests and tree plantations — forests planted to produce a lot 
                       of wood, often with just one or two types of fast-growing trees, like 
                       eucalyptus or acacia. Looking at more than 260 studies from 53 
                       countries, they found that native forests blew plantations out of the 
                       water on almost all the ecological benefits they studied, in terms of 
                       storing carbon, preventing soil erosion, managing water supplies, and 
                       providing habitat for plants and animals.

                        trillion more trees; it is with the word ‘planting,’” the journalist 
                        Fred Pearce wrote in the book A Trillion Trees: How We Can Reforest Our World.
                         Pearce pointed out that Europe has a third more trees now than it did 
                        in 1900, mostly a result of natural regrowth. “Natural regeneration,” as
                         the phenomenon is called, has often taken place by accident, with trees growing in as people moved out of the countryside in places like Brazil, Costa Rica, and Nepal.

                        Not only is letting trees grow back the cheapest and easiest option, 
researchers argue, but it’s also the most effective approach for storing
 carbon in forests. One analysis found that natural forests are, on 
average, 40 times better at sequestering carbon than plantations, which 
are regularly harvested and cleared, limiting their potential.

                        Tree planting still has a place in addressing climate change, experts
                        say, but not a central role. Overpromising the benefits can be 
                       dangerous from a climate perspective, and overdoing it can damage local 
                       environments. The priority, it seems, should be on making space for 
                       forests to regrow and protecting existing forests. The recent IPCC 
                       report found that reducing deforestation and forest degradation is “one of the most effective and robust options” to mitigate climate change.”

                        “In most places, to restore the world’s 
                        forests we need to do just two things: to ensure that ownership of the 
                        world’s forests is vested in the people who live in them, and to give 
                        nature room,” Pearce wrote. Forests that are owned by Indigenous people 
                        and local communities, as opposed to governments or businesses, are 
                        linked to better outcomes: lower rates of deforestation, higher carbon storage, and better social and economic results.

                        Hua and other experts say that tree-planting efforts still have an 
                        important role to play, especially in areas where nature can’t bounce 
                        back as easily. Some formerly forested land is too degraded, or too far 
                        from any existing forests, to benefit from natural regrowth, she said. 
                        Just waiting around, “you may not end up having a natural forest coming 
                        back,” Hua said. “The ecosystem may just be arrested in a particular 
                        degraded state for a long time.” Planting native species can accelerate the recovery time.

                        Hua thinks there’s a place for tree plantations too. It all comes 
down to trade-offs. Mass-planting is an effective way to grow a lot of 
timber, for instance, which can relieve pressure on local native forests
 that might otherwise get logged, she said.

                        So there is a place for humans to help forests — but it’s more about 
                        careful planning than sticking billions of saplings in the ground 
                        wherever they seem to fit.
