                    <p>
                        Cycling lowers your carbon footprint and noise pollution and is one of the best
 ways you can reduce your impact on the environment . Read on to 
discover more reasons why changing your commute can have a big impact on
 the environment.

                    <p>
                        Sustainability can be a confusing word, we get 
it. A big part of the problem is that there isn’t a universal or legal 
definition. The best starting point for us is to figure out what we care
 about and what we’re trying to achieve. Do we want to lower our carbon 
footprint? Do we want cleaner air? Do we want workers to be treated 
fairly? Do we want to protect the animals, flowers, and trees in our 
backyard? It’s a tall order to fill, but we can take our first and 
easiest step with a bike.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section">
                    <h2 class="sub-heading">It relies on your pedal power not fossil fuels</h2>
                    <p>
                        There’s no such thing as zero footprint or carbon neutral, literally. The best 
we can do is minimize our impact by making incremental changes to what 
we already do every day. For instance, if you must drive, consider 
carpooling. If you have a scooter or motorcycle, consider switching to 
an electric version or an e-bike; most importantly, make sure the 
charging station offers renewable energy like solar power. The key is to
 reduce our reliance on inefficient vehicles and fossil fuels. Cycling 
is a great option because the only energy we’re consuming is our own and
 it comes with health benefits!

                <div class="section">
                    <h2 class="sub-heading">It lowers your costs and carbon footprint</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every purchase we make has an impact. We want to choose products that are 
efficient, that last for a long time, and don’t produce toxic byproducts
 at any stage of the product’s life. It’s also a lot gentler on your 
wallet long-term! Repairing and maintaining bikes is also easy and fast –
 whether you do the work yourself or take it to your local bike shop 
mechanic. Many of the tools for repair and maintenance can be bought at 
your local bike shop as well – and some retailers even offer basic intro
 seminars you can take to learn to fix a flat tire, for example.

                    <h2 class="sub-heading">It improves air quality for everyone</h2>
                    <p>
                        By choosing biking as your main transportation method, you not only 
contribute to reducing pollution but you’re also helping improve the air
 quality in your neighborhood. For example, riding
 a commuter bike to work instead of driving will lower your greenhouse 
gas emissions by approximately 3,000 pounds every year - not only 
safeguarding your health but also that of your community.
                    </p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2 class="sub-heading">It means less congestion and traffic on the road</h2>
                    <p>
                        We often think driving is a faster alternative to riding but in most 
cities, it’s not necessarily the case. By leaving fossil fuel-based 
transportation behind, we avoid unbearable traffic jams, piling costs, 
and getting stuck in a cloud of toxic particles. According to 
independent studies done by INRIX, Americans lost $1,348 on average per 
driver per year in 2018 due to congestion; they factor in things like 
lost time, health side-effects, fuel lost during idling, etc. On the 
other hand, cycling gives you the freedom to switch routes, go through a
 park for fresh air, and often gets you to your destination faster. Need
 any more persuading?!

                <div class="section">
                    <h2 class="sub-heading">It helps reduce noise pollution</h2>
                    <p>
                        Over long periods, noise pollution can be a risk to our health and wildlife. A sound that goes above 85 decibels can harm our hearing. For reference, subway trains fall in the 90-115 decibels range; imagine hearing that every day! They also change animals’ habits and 
threaten their survival by confusing animals that rely on sound to catch
 their food. We know we sound like a broken record, but riding a bike 
really is one of the best things we can do to empower ourselves and 
achieve a more eco-friendly life. Even the act of being able to 
appreciate quieter natural spaces can help us be more aware of the 
environment and give us a chance to reflect on our impact.

                <div class="section">
                    <h2 class="sub-heading">Make riding your first step towards sustainability</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cycling for sustainability is already a global movement: local authorities are 
investing billions in making cities more bike-friendly; people are 
cycling for climate justice; there are countless cities where bikes 
empower the less privileged for their survival and the list goes on. No 
solution is perfect, of course and as a consumer we might feel small in 
the grand scheme of things. But if we all play our parts in living a 
more sustainable lifestyle, we have the power to change the world, one 
ride at a time.
